## JavaScript Security Engineering Demo

Get Docker image of the DVWA app and showcase how XSS can be problematic:

1. Basic example showing an alert
2. Stealing cookie and logging in in a different browser, or incognito tab
3. Gathering information about `document.domain` and putting the content we want
4. Phishing by adding login and password input fields
5. Keylogger
